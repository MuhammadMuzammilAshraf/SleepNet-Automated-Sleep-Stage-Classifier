# Automated Sleep Stage Classification System

Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive function, emotional stability, and overall health. It consists of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) stages:
- **REM Sleep**: Characterized by vivid dreams, high brain activity, and muscle paralysis. Critical for emotional processing and memory consolidation.
- **NREM Sleep**: Includes N1 (light sleep), N2 (body relaxation), and N3 (deep sleep for tissue repair and immune strengthening).

Advances in technology allow for the collection of sleep data (EEG, EOG, EMG), crucial for understanding sleep disorders. ML and DL models can automate the classification of these stages, improving accuracy and reducing manual scoring efforts.

### Problem Statement
Sleep disorders like insomnia, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy affect millions. Traditional manual scoring of sleep stages is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated classification systems are needed to enhance large-scale sleep studies and diagnostics.

### Aims and Objectives
This project aims to develop an automated sleep stage classification system using ML and DL:
- Utilize open-access physiological signal datasets (EEG, EOG, EMG).
- Train models to classify sleep stages and detect disorders.
- Reduce time and inter-scorer variability in manual scoring.
- Improve understanding of sleep patterns for better diagnostics.
- Integrate the system into large-scale studies to advance patient care.
